Yes, we had many fights and misunderstandings, but every emotion came from love.
Even when we were angry, our hearts never wanted to lose each other.
We both are imperfect, learning, and growing step by step together.
Real love is not about never fighting, it is about choosing each other every day.
I still choose you, Meena, with all my heart.
My love for you is unconditional, patient, and true.
I hope we heal, understand, and hold each other more gently from now on.`;
