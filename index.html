Your dedication, patience, and quiet strength inspire me more than you realize. Even on tired days, you never give up, and that’s what makes you truly beautiful to me. Remember, every late night and every effort you put in is taking you closer to your dreams. Believe in yourself the way I believe in you, because you are capable of amazing things. No matter how tough the syllabus feels, I’m always standing beside you, cheering for you silently. Now go ace your exams… because once you finish studying, can I be the chapter you revise for the rest of your life? 💖`;
